Oriental Swedish keyboard:  
with additional letters for romanization of languages with Arabic script  
Version 1.0  

The additional letters for romanization of the selected languages are based on the romanization schemes created by the Library of Congress. The keyboard layout covers English and Swedish languages, in addition to romanization of Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Sindhi and Pushto.  

The "-" key (hyphen) has been converted to a dead key. Dead keys are used as follows: Pressing the dead key alone will do nothing, pressing some additional key will produce specific output.  

All additional letters to standard Swedish:  

Á á  (already included using the dead key ´)  
Ā Ī Ū   ā ī ū  (accessed with the dead key -)  
Ḍ Ḥ Ṛ Ṣ Ṭ Ẓ   ạ ḍ ḥ ṇ ṛ ṣ ṭ ẓ  (accessed with the dead key -)  
G̲ K̲ S̲ Z̲   g̲ h̲ k̲ n̲ s̲ z̲  (press the corresponding key then - then _)
